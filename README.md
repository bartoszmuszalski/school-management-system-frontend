## Overview

This is the frontend repository for the School Management System (SMS) project. The application is designed to streamline and modernize education management for students, teachers, and administrators. It provides a user-friendly interface for accessing grades, managing schedules, facilitating communication, and other essential functions.

## Key Features

*   **Responsive User Interface:** Adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Different user roles (administrator, teacher, student) have access to specific features.
*   **Dynamic Data Display:** Displays real-time information fetched from the backend API.
*   **Form Management:** User-friendly forms for creating, editing, and managing data.
*   **[Add other specific key features of *your* frontend here]**

## Technology Stack

*   **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **JavaScript:** Programming language for frontend logic.
*   **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the UI.
*   **CSS:** Styling and layout of the application.
*   **[Add any other libraries or frameworks you used, e.g., react-router-dom, axios, UI libraries]**

## Backend Integration

The frontend communicates with a backend REST API (separate repository: [link to backend repository, if public]) to fetch and manage data.

*   **API Endpoints:** [Describe the key API endpoints the frontend uses (e.g., /users, /grades, /classes)]
*   **Data Format:** JSON

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [your repository URL]
    cd school-management-system-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure API URL:**

    *   Update the API base URL in `src/config.js` (or wherever you store your API configuration) to point to your backend server.  *(Adapt this instruction to your project's actual configuration)*

4.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will start the development server, and the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the default address for your setup).

## Development

*   **Directory Structure:**  *(Briefly describe the main directories in your project (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `services`))*
*   **Coding Conventions:**  *(If you followed specific coding conventions, mention them here)*
